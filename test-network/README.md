## Running the test network

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up a simple MHchain test network. The test network has two commiter organizations with one commiter each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy chaincode. For more information, see *Using the MHchain test network*. The test network is being introduced in MHchain v2.0 as the long term replacement for the `first-network` sample.

Before you can deploy the test network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images] in the Mihongtech MHchain documentation.
